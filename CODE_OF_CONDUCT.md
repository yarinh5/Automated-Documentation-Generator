# ðŸ“œ Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Being respectful and kind** to other community members
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language** in all interactions
- **Being constructive** when giving feedback or criticism
- **Focusing on what is best** for the community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Being patient** with newcomers and those learning
- **Accepting responsibility** for our mistakes and learning from them
- **Giving credit** where credit is due

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment** of any kind, including sexual harassment
- **Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments** directed at individuals or groups
- **Public or private harassment** of any kind
- **Publishing others' private information** without explicit permission
- **Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate** in a professional setting
- **Dismissing or attacking** inclusion-oriented requests
- **Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior**

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [conduct@myproject.com](mailto:conduct@myproject.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
