- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a suggested fix (optional)

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial response**: We will provide an initial response within 72 hours
- **Regular updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue

### 4. Disclosure timeline

- **Immediate**: We will acknowledge receipt and begin investigation

- **Public disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your API keys secure**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure key management
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS when transmitting sensitive data
   - Verify SSL certificates

3. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update your dependencies
   - Monitor for security advisories

4. **Review generated content**
   - Always review AI-generated content before publishing
   - Be aware of potential security implications

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file paths and content
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Error handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use security scanning tools
   - Audit dependencies regularly

4. **Code review**
   - All code changes should be reviewed
   - Pay special attention to security-sensitive areas
   - Use static analysis tools
